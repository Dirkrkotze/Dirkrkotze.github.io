I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

The department expressed the need to digitize their research and development pipeline concerning the manufacturing of tea products. The application provides an interface for experts to complete an e-scorecard which is stored directly on the application. Completed scorecards can be either individually or bulk exported to customized PDF or XLSX documents. The application also provides a robust sorting and searching algorithm to identify completed e-scorecards. The project source code can not be made public as this is a paid project, though a viewing may be arranged at the request of a future potential employer.',
